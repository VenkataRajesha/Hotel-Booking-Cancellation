# HOTEL BOOKING CANCELLATION:

INTRODUCTION :
    A hotel is an establishment that provides paid accommodation, generally for a short duration of stay. Hotels often provide a number of additional guest services, such as restaurants, bars, swimming pools, healthcare, retail shops; business facilities like conference halls, banquet halls, boardrooms; and space for private parties like birthdays, marriages, kitty parties, etc. 
There are various factors that affect the day-to-day business in this industry. Some of the major factors affecting the business are high competition between hotels, improper marketing strategy, ineffective pricing model, customer dissatisfaction due to inability to satisfy their requests.  

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Hotel cancellations have been rising in the past few years due to the presence of online websites (OTA) like Booking.com, expedia.com, etc. Numerical data shows that with the exception of 2018, every single channel has observed a marked increase in cancellation rate YoY. And, even in 2018, the number was 7.1 points above 2014.   

OTA´s are encouraging customers to cancel by providing services like book now and cancel later, free of charge, whenever you want. This results in customers booking more than one hotel and making a final decision for their stay later on, hence resulting in cancellations.
Examples of the impact of cancellations on a hotel:
  • Loss of revenue when they cannot resell the room.
  • Additional costs of distribution channels by increasing commissions or paying for publicity to help sell these rooms.
  • Lowering prices last minute, so they can resell a room, resulting in reducing profit margin. 

OBJECTIVE:
 The objective is to classify the customers who tend to cancel the booking and analyze the reasons for their cancellation.
